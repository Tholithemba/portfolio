  <h1>Daily Prayer</h1>
  <p>
    "Gracious heavenly father, you have
    wake us because of your mercy upon us.
    As we start our day, may your favour,
    love, and protection be upon us.
    Give us wisdom to manage the day
    and all days to come. We pray with

    <h1>Motivation</h1>
    <p>
      I am an excellent communicator and strive to ensure each member of the team is informed of their
      responsibilities and that everyone is on the same page. My attention to detail is great and I am able to
      juggle multiple responsibilities at once. However, my greatest asset likely lies in being able to see the big
      picture and to plan accordingly as well as being flexible and creative enough to deal with obstacles as
      they arise.

                It is what I desire that pushes me to the edge
                of success. The hunger to overcome every battle
                is what drives me to do better everyday. I always
                have an interest and passion for learning and
                Experiencing new skills. I am Tholithemba Mngomezulu.
                I grew up in rural area
                called Nongoma. I started Ekuthokozeni primary
                school at ekuthokozen which is 3 minutes away
                from home and went to Banzana secondary school
                which is almost 10 minutes away from home
                (walking distance). After completing my matric
                in 2007, I took a gap year, then the
                following year I went to University of Zululand
                and completed BSc Applied Mathematics and mathematics
                in 2013. I then went to University of Witwatersrand
                in 2016 and completed BSc Computer Science and
                Information Systems in 2019.

                I expeirenced that learning and experiencing new
                skills is a life time process. My
                experience working with cross-functional teams has
                taught me the importance of building trusted
                relationships and inspiring a shared project vision.
                I usual specialize in programming section, but If I
                can expand my knowledge in almost all computer skills
                , I will be more creative. Apart from coding, I also
                have other basics computer skills like installing
                operating systems and other computer software
                applications on new computers. I am an active user of
                both Linux and windows operating systems. Iâ€™m
                familiar with basic command lines when using terminal both Linux and windows.
